init â€“ Initialize a new MiniGit repository

add â€“ Stage files for commit

commit â€“ Save staged changes with a message

log â€“ View commit history

branch â€“ Create and list branches

checkout â€“ Switch between branches or commits

merge â€“ Merge branches together

diff â€“ View differences between file versions
